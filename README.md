# Setup project
- run `npm i` to install dependencies
- run `npm start` to start the application

after start you should be able to access the app [here](http://localhost:4200/)(http://localhost:4200/)

P.S. port might be different if 4200 is busy

# Create account
- using sign up button, you can create a new account (any data is acceptable)
# Install extra deps
- install any cypress related libs you might need, using npm

# Cover some files with tests
- add at least 2-3 cypress test files
